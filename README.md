# DROP THE BEAT

DROP THE BEAT is a fun & competitive live multiplayer ‚Äúname that song‚Äù game. Two players can join a host's game room and guess the song titles in a selected playlist simultaneously by listening to short clips of the tunes.

While incorporating complex game logic behind the scenes, the design was strategically simple and clean to enhance the UX/UI.

This app was created as part of the final project for Lighthouse Labs (Web Development Bootcamp). The goal was to create a full-stack application from start to finish (including project planning and a 5 minute demo) in just two weeks.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this app is two-fold. Firstly, simple online games (i.e. [Scribbl IO](https://skribbl.io/), [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/), [Codenames](https://codenames.game/) and [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/)) have a way to bring people together through small moments of joy - which is much needed during these times. Secondly, we love music - music is the universal language! We combined these two ideas to create a fun game that any group of people can play together and jam to.
