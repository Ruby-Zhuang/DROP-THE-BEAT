# Features
Host can:
- select a playlist; 
- invite players to guess the songs in that playlist just by listening to a short clip of the tunes;
- control the gameflow by clicking "next song" at any moment;
- cheer up players or give them hints in the live chat.

Players can:
- change their name upon arrival;
- compete with other players by typing the correct song title (case  insensitive) in the live chat;
- get a score for the correct answer and see it live updated on the top of the chat board.

The song album cover reveals as soon as it's guessed or when the time runs out (30 seconds default). 
When the playlist runs out of songs, the result page reveals and congratulates the winner.

# Usage
